## üéØ Current Status
**Last Updated:** January 10, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Core App Development  
**Status:** üèóÔ∏è **FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - SvelteKit + DaisyUI project setup finished  
**Next Milestone:** Working app inventory with ADB integration

## üèóÔ∏è Vision & Architecture

### Project Purpose
A **SvelteKit web application** that provides visual management of Android apps through ADB commands, specifically designed for the Samsung Fold 5 ‚Üí Fold 7 migration cleanup process.

### Core Objectives
1. **Visual App Inventory** - See all apps with names, sizes, and categories
2. **ADB Integration** - Direct Android Debug Bridge command execution
3. **Selective Cleanup** - Granular control over app removal
4. **Storage Analysis** - Clear insights into storage usage patterns
5. **Migration Preparation** - Clean phone before Samsung Smart Switch transfer

### Technical Architecture
**SvelteKit Full-Stack Application:**
```
DaisyUI Frontend (App Management Grid)
    ‚Üì [HTTP requests]
SvelteKit API Routes (/api/apps/*)
    ‚Üì [child_process.exec]
ADB Commands (Samsung Fold 5)
    ‚Üì [USB connection]
Android Device Management
```

### Data Flow
```
Samsung Fold 5 (RFCW708JTVX)
    ‚Üì [adb shell pm list packages]
SvelteKit Server Routes
    ‚Üì [JSON responses]
DaisyUI App Grid Interface
    ‚Üì [user selections]
Bulk App Uninstall Actions
```

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

- [ ] **Category Classification** - Group apps by type (social, games, etc.)
- [ ] **Install Date Detection** - Show when apps were installed

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features üìã **PLANNED**
**Goal:** Advanced cleanup capabilities and user experience improvements

#### Advanced UI Features (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Search & Filtering** - Real-time app search and category filters
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Multi-select with batch uninstall capabilities
- [ ] **Storage Visualization** - Charts and graphs for storage breakdown
- [ ] **Cleanup Recommendations** - Automated suggestions for app removal

#### Smart Analysis (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Usage Patterns** - Identify rarely used apps for cleanup
- [ ] **Duplicate Detection** - Find apps with similar functionality
- [ ] **System App Safety** - Warn against removing critical system apps
- [ ] **Backup Reminders** - Suggest data backup before app removal

#### Error Handling & Recovery (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Device Disconnection** - Handle USB disconnection gracefully
- [ ] **Failed Uninstalls** - Retry logic for protected apps
- [ ] **Rollback Capabilities** - Ability to reinstall accidentally removed apps
- [ ] **Progress Tracking** - Visual feedback for long-running operations

### Phase 3: Migration Integration üîÆ **FUTURE**
**Goal:** Direct integration with Samsung Smart Switch migration workflow

#### Pre-Migration Analysis (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Transfer Baggage Calculator** - Estimate what will transfer with apps
- [ ] **Cleanup Impact Metrics** - Show storage and performance gains
- [ ] **Migration Readiness Check** - Validate phone is ready for transfer
- [ ] **Backup Verification** - Ensure important data is backed up

#### Smart Switch Integration (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Transfer Preview** - Show what will transfer after cleanup
- [ ] **Category-based Cleanup** - Target specific app types for removal
- [ ] **Essential App Protection** - Prevent accidental removal of critical apps
- [ ] **Migration Timeline** - Coordinate cleanup with transfer schedule

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Framework & Technology Stack ‚úÖ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** SvelteKit + DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale:** 
- SvelteKit provides full-stack capability with server routes for ADB commands
- DaisyUI offers consistent, accessible components without custom CSS
- JavaScript-only for simplicity (no TypeScript complexity)
- pnpm for modern package management

### UI Architecture ‚úÖ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** App Management Grid (Option 2) over Category Dashboard  
**Rationale:**
- Direct app-level control for granular cleanup decisions
- Multi-select capabilities for bulk operations
- Clear visual feedback for storage impact
- Better suited for migration preparation workflow

### API Design ‚úÖ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** REST API (Option A) over WebSocket real-time  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for initial version
- Standard HTTP patterns familiar to developers
- Easier error handling and retry logic
- WebSocket can be added later for real-time features

### ADB Integration Strategy ‚úÖ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** Direct command execution in SvelteKit server routes  
**Implementation:**
- Node.js `child_process.exec()` for ADB commands
- Target Samsung Fold 5 specifically using serial `RFCW708JTVX`
- Error handling for device connection issues
- Command validation to prevent harmful operations

### Package Management ‚úÖ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** pnpm with downgraded package versions  
**Rationale:**
- User preference for pnpm over npm
- Node v22.7.0 compatibility requires older SvelteKit versions
- Svelte 4.x instead of 5.x for stability
- DaisyUI 4.x for proven component library

## üìà Success Metrics
