    ↓ [child_process.exec]
ADB Commands (Samsung Fold 5)
    ↓ [USB connection]
Android Device Management
```

### Data Flow

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Framework & Technology Stack ✅ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** SvelteKit + DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale:** 
- SvelteKit provides full-stack capability with server routes for ADB commands
- DaisyUI offers consistent, accessible components without custom CSS
- JavaScript-only for simplicity (no TypeScript complexity)
- pnpm for modern package management

### UI Architecture ✅ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** App Management Grid (Option 2) over Category Dashboard  
**Rationale:**
- Direct app-level control for granular cleanup decisions
- Multi-select capabilities for bulk operations
- Clear visual feedback for storage impact
- Better suited for migration preparation workflow

### API Design ✅ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** REST API (Option A) over WebSocket real-time  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for initial version
- Standard HTTP patterns familiar to developers
- Easier error handling and retry logic
- WebSocket can be added later for real-time features

### ADB Integration Strategy ✅ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** Direct command execution in SvelteKit server routes  
**Implementation:**
- Node.js `child_process.exec()` for ADB commands
- Target Samsung Fold 5 specifically using serial `RFCW708JTVX`
- Error handling for device connection issues
- Command validation to prevent harmful operations

### Package Management ✅ **DECIDED**
**Decision:** pnpm with downgraded package versions  
**Rationale:**
- User preference for pnpm over npm
- Node v22.7.0 compatibility requires older SvelteKit versions
- Svelte 4.x instead of 5.x for stability
- DaisyUI 4.x for proven component library
